This is a test document for our document processor.
It contains multiple lines of text to process.

The document processor should:
1. Handle this text file efficiently
2. Extract its content correctly
3. Provide accurate metadata
4. Manage memory usage appropriately

This test document will help us verify that our optimizations are working correctly.
